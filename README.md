# HelloApp
My first React app, it's silly but still pretty neat. 

Basically I created a super simple React application for practice that features three components that get housed into a single component:

Header:
- Includes a "logo" via a H1 and a small navigation menu.

Body:
- The main body content of the app, includes a paragraph that looks for the value of a {name} variable.
- An image supplied from Unsplash. Special thanks and credit goes to Sebastian Unrau for the awesome forest pic!

Footer:
- one line credit and copyright


There's also a prompt() that then takes the user's entry and updates the "name" variable with whatever is entered.
If nothing is entered, the display defaults to Friend.
